This repo includes the analyses for a recent review paper on the life cycles of parasites that infect grazing mammals. 
#Background
Parasitic worms are generally transmitted trophically - the host gets infected by consuming an infective parasite stage. Grazers should theoretically be able to get infected by consuming vegetation contaminated with parasite eggs. However, a number of worms infect via intermediate hosts, even though this seems unnecessary. To understand how worms typically infect grazing mammals, we decided to quantify the number of times different transmission routes have evolved and to quantify the number of taxa exhibiting different strategies.

In this repo, there are two main analyses. The first [maps helminth transmission strategies onto a tree](analysis/mapping/mapping_ungulate_helminths.Rmd). The second looks at propagule characteristics.
